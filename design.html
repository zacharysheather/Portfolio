						<p><strong>Throughout my degree i created the following designs.</strong></p>
						<center><img src="/images/website.png" alt="Website"></center><br/>
						<p>This was a website that was created in a web development unit. This involved creating
						a portfolio that would be constructed using Notepad++ or other similar software, and then
						be uploaded onto the web server at the University. The project involved creating numerous pages
						using CSS, HTML and JavaScript as the types of computer languages.</p><br/>
						<center><img src="/images/storybook.png" alt="Storybook"></center><br/>
						<p>This project involved constructing a storybook using Google Web Designer. The product that was
						constructed was based on the idea of the transition through someone enrolling in University and then
						graduating years later. The product was developed using CSS, HTML, JavaScript, PhotoShop and Audacity.</p><br/>
						<center><img src="/images/jumpandrun.png" alt="Jump and Run"></center><br/>
						<p>This was a jump and run game called "Escaping St Helena. The product was constructed using Google Web Designer
						and was developed using CSS, HTML, JavaScript, PhotoShop and Audacity. As well as the storybook project, 
						it was required that design documentation was constructed before developing the game in Google Web Designer was to occur.
						The use of Wireframes were used using Moqups as the chosen online software, which allowed the interaction between pages
						to be shown in an effective manner.</p><br/>
						<center><img src="/images/zacharysbigburgers.png" alt="Zachary's Big Burgers"></center><br/>
						<p>This project involved constructing a prototype for a fictional food product. For this project i created the idea of 
						a company being constructed called Zachary's Big Burgers, where the food product would be the Big Bacon Burger. For this
						project the use of PhotoShop was used to construct the tilestyle's for the product, which would later be used to construct
						the prototype using Adobe XD. For the project the need for a 30 second advertisement was needed to be constructed also. This
						was done using Adobe Rush, which would be used to edit the video and add a title page, credits and transitions.</p>
